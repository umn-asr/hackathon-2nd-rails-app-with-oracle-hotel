# create remote context

docker context create remote \
  --docker host=ssh://swadm@asr-drone-dev-app-01.oit.umn.edu

# seems like docker holds onto these contexts across projects.
# starting this in a new repo, I expected to have to create the
# context again but it was already there.
# may want to rm context on shutdown, and add on startup

# tried to `docker-compose up` like below
# various errors worked through
# - until `Error while fetching server API version`
# led to me to realize swadm didn't have the correct permissions

# then had to add swadm to docker group per link shared by Tony
# confirmed added correctly: after sign out, sign back - run `docker run hello-world` successful

# build container on remote host
# using remote context, docker-compose up
#     - I think this saying use the settings of docker-compose.yml, but override
#     docker-compose.yml with settings in docker-compose.prod.yml
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml --context remote up -d

# build seemed frozen so re-ran with --verbose
# build failed from line 11 RUN command in Dockerfile:

# Unsure if:
  - Dockerfile should be changed
  - or if prod needs its own Dockerfile like docker-compose
  - or if there's a setting I need to change on the server

# Trying to learn more about the Dockerfile in order to troubleshoot better

# After further research, it seems like the ideal is to keep
# the same Dockerfile, and use ENV variables if you need to
# But I'm still unsure why build is failing

# After running the `up` command, now the error is:

E: Unable to locate package alien
E: Package 'build-essential' has no installation candidate
E: Unable to locate package freetds-dev
E: Unable to locate package libaio-dev

# Hangs for a long time at:

docker.api.build._set_auth_headers: Looking for auth config
docker.auth._resolve_authconfig_credstore: Looking for auth entry for 'https://asr-docker-local.artifactory.umn.edu'

# Research says this could be b/c it's passing a large file, not
# sure what that would be.

# It does eventually complete, however.

# I added another `apt-get update` before `BUILD_PACKAGES`
# hoping that would help it find the packages, but now I
# have both previous errors
